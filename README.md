# 2. Background of Development
The number of coffee shops nationwide in 2018 has been on the rise, with about 150,000 in Gyeonggi Province alone and about 140,000 in Seoul. On the other hand, the annual closing rate is 14.1%, higher than the 8.4% chicken restaurant called "the grave of self-employed people," which is causing social losses. In addition, due to the improvement of the interior of franchise coffee shops, the reality of the poor and the poor between small and medium-sized coffee shops and franchise coffee shops is getting worse. As the number of students and office workers studying and working at cafes increases, the number of customers visiting franchise coffee shops is also increasing.
In the study of the purpose of visiting coffee shops, "To utilize space and spend private time," gained the highest importance. In other words, many people visit cafes for space use, not for coffee itself, and that purpose is important.
In this paper, we aim to apply an application that connects empty seats (supply), which is a concern for small business owners who operate an increasing number of coffee shops based on the shared economy, with students (demand) who need to secure space for studies, reading, and socializing.
